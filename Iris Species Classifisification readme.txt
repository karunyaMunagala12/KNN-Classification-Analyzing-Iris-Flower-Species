Project Title: Iris Species Classification with K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Overview
This project focuses on exploring the famous Fisher's Iris dataset and implementing a machine learning algorithm called K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify iris flower species. The Iris dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning and serves as a great introduction to classification problems.

Description
The main objective of this project is to build a KNN classifier that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The project involves the following steps:

Data Exploration and Analysis: Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to gain insights into the distribution, relationships, and characteristics of the features.

Data Preprocessing: Preparing the dataset for model training by performing tasks such as handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

K Nearest Neighbors: Implementing the KNN algorithm, which is a non-parametric classification method that predicts the class of a sample based on the classes of its nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Model Training and Evaluation: Training the KNN classifier on the training set and evaluating its performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization and Interpretation: Visualizing the decision boundaries created by the KNN classifier to understand how it separates different iris species. Additionally, interpreting the results and discussing any insights gained from the classification process.
